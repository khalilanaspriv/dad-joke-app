## ✨ About The Project

I built this Dad Joke App using HTML, CSS, and JS. I mastered **asynchronous operations** using **`fetch()`** and **`async/await`** without freezing the browser. I added **`try...catch`** error handling and used **`.style.visibility`** with the **`isLoading`** flag to manage the button state while fetching. I've learned a lot doing this little fun project. This was my very first time using fetch and async/await in JS.

### 🛠️ Built With

The project was entirely built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS**.
